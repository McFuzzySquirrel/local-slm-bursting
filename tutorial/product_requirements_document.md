# Product Requirements Document: Local SLM Bursting Application

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Users need to leverage language models for various tasks but face challenges with:
- Cost of using cloud-based models
- Privacy concerns with sending sensitive data to external APIs
- Network connectivity requirements
- Slower response times from remote APIs

### 1.2 Product Vision
A hybrid solution that runs Small Language Models (SLMs) locally with the ability to "burst" to more powerful cloud models when necessary, providing cost-effective, private, and always-available language model capabilities.

### 1.3 Target Users
- Developers building LLM-powered applications
- Researchers working with language models
- Privacy-conscious organizations
- Users in environments with limited connectivity

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The application uses a two-component architecture:
1. **Backend API (FastAPI)**: Handles model loading, inference, and management
2. **Frontend UI (Streamlit)**: Provides user interface for interaction and configuration

### 2.2 Key Components
- **Local Model Runner**: Loads and runs GGUF-format models using llama.cpp
- **Burst Controller**: Decides when to use local vs. cloud models
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles application settings and model parameters
- **File Management System**: Handles uploads and generated content

### 2.3 Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, llama.cpp
- **Frontend**: Python, Streamlit
- **Environment**: Python virtual environment (venv)
- **Deployment**: Windows batch scripts
- **Configuration**: Environment variables via .env file

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core Functionality
- **Local Model Inference**: Run text generation/completion with locally-stored models
- **Model Management**: List, select, and configure available models
- **Burst Capability**: Seamlessly switch to cloud models when needed based on configurable criteria
- **Settings Management**: Configure model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
- **Session Management**: Maintain context across interactions

### 3.2 User Interface
- Model selection dropdown
- Text input area with parameters
- Output display with formatting
- Settings panel for configuration
- Monitoring panel showing current model status

### 3.3 Deployment & Installation
- Single-script setup process that:
  - Creates virtual environment
  - Installs dependencies
  - Sets up configuration
  - Creates necessary directories
  - Starts all components
- Separate scripts for component-level controls

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- Response time under 2 seconds for local models (depending on hardware)
- Graceful degradation under load
- Efficient memory management for model loading/unloading

### 4.2 Reliability
- Automatic error recovery
- Proper handling of model loading failures
- Connectivity loss management for cloud models

### 4.3 Security
- Local data processing for sensitive information
- Configurable API keys and credentials for cloud services
- No data persistence without explicit configuration

### 4.4 Usability
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive UI workflow
- Help documentation included
- Easy installation process
